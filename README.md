# FastFlow for Copy Detection Patterns

## Description
FastFlow, by Yu et. al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07677), is a state of the art normalizing flow model for anomaly detection for the MVTec AD dataset (https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad).

This project is an implementation of the (to date, 22.03.2022) non-available source code for our own Copy Detection Patterns (CDPs) dataset.

## Requirements
The code is meant to be run on Python 3.8. Code dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
